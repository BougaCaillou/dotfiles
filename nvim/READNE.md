# State of this thing

This is my old Neovim config. Started fro scratch, using Packer, and installed
plugins as I needed them.

I have now moved to using lazy with Lazyvim, and made a completely different
folder for that to avoid confusion, also to allow to go bck if needed.

Check out [lazyvim](https://github.com/BougaCaillou/dotfiles/tree/main/lazyvim)
for the new config.
